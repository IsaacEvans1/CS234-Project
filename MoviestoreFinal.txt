Who needs streaming services when you can open an old-fashioned movie store? For our store we have created a program that maintains inventory of several categories of movies, performs transactions, keeps a log of employees, and has reporting for inventory and transactions. 
The inventoryManagement class is the superclass for the movie subclass. The categories established within the inventoryManagement class determine the price of the movie. The movie subclass creates the array that holds the movie objects then adds the genre and the specific movie titles. The search function will help employees find a movie for a customer that fits a certain genre, category, or title.
The employee class contains an array of current employees. This class allows for employees to be added as well as terminated in the system. When an employee is added to the system, they are assigned an employee number. The employee’s information can then be assigned to a transaction. 
Once a customer has selected their movies, The CashRegister class contains the methods necessary for completing transactions. The employee can add or remove items as well as add the customers information onto the transaction. There are also getTotal and clear methods if needed. The transaction is complete when the payment method is run. At this point, a transaction will be logged within a transaction array. 
If there is a question about a transaction, the transactionReport class is the answer. TransactionReport is a report generating class which prints transactions. Transactions can be printed by employee, movie, or customer lookup.
Another helpful reporting tool built into the program is the InventoryReport class which helps determine on hand inventory levels. Methods for this class include a report method of totalInv() which gives the total number of movies on hand. TotalCat() also give a number of items on hand that fit that a specific category (popular, classic, or new release) to determine the price. The inventory class even has a search function which will enable the user to find the specific movie a customer is searching for.
These classes work together to build a great program for movie sales!
